i.MX31 specific Configuration Options:
--------------------------------------

- Timer precision:
		CONFIG_MX31_TIMER_HIGH_PRECISION

		Enable higher precision timer. The low-precision timer
		(default) provides approximately 4% error, whereas the
		high-precision timer is about 0.4% accurate. The extra
		accuracy is achieved at the cost of higher computational
		overhead, which, in places where time is measured, should
		not be critical, so, it should be safe to enable this
		option.
