	  Support for all ARM1176-/BCM2835-based Raspberry Pi variants, such as
	  the A, A+, B, B+, Compute Module, and Zero. This option cannot
	  support BCM2836/BCM2837-based Raspberry Pis such as the RPi 2 and
	  RPi 3 due to different peripheral address maps.

	  This option creates a build targetting the ARM1176 ISA.

config TARGET_RPI_2
	bool "Raspberry Pi 2"
	help
	  Support for all BCM2836-based Raspberry Pi variants, such as
	  the RPi 2 model B.

	  This option also supports BCM2837-based variants such as the RPi 3
	  Model B, when run in 32-bit mode, provided you have configured the
	  VideoCore firmware to select the PL011 UART for the console by:
	  a) config.txt should contain dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt.
	  b) You should run the following to tell the VC FW to process DT when
	  booting, and copy u-boot.bin.img (rather than u-boot.bin) to the SD
	  card as the kernel image:

	       path/to/kernel/scripts/mkknlimg --dtok u-boot.bin u-boot.bin.img

	  This works as of firmware.git commit 046effa13ebc "firmware:
	  arm_loader: emmc clock depends on core clock See:
	  https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/572".

	  This option creates a build targetting the ARMv7/AArch32 ISA.

	help
	  Support for all BCM2837-based Raspberry Pi variants, such as
	  the RPi 3 model B, in AArch32 (32-bit) mode.

	  This option assumes the VideoCore firmware is configured to use the
	  mini UART (rather than PL011) for the serial console. This is the
	  default on the RPi 3. To enable the UART console, the following non-
	  default option must be present in config.txt: enable_uart=1.
