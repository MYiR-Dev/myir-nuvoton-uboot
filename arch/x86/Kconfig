	  This target is used for running U-Boot on top of Coreboot. In
	  this case Coreboot does the early inititalisation, and U-Boot
	  takes over once the RAM, video and CPU are fully running.
	  U-Boot is loaded as a fallback payload from Coreboot, in
	  Coreboot terminology. This method was used for the Chromebook
	  Pixel when launched.

config TARGET_CHROMEBOOK_LINK
