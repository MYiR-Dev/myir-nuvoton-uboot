How to use U-Boot on Engicam i.CoreM6 DualLite/Solo and Quad/Dual Starter Kit:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Build U-Boot for Engicam i.CoreM6 QDL:

$ make mrproper
$ make icorem6qdl_mmc_defconfig
$ make

This will generate the SPL image called SPL and the u-boot-dtb.img.

- Flash the SPL image into the micro SD card:

sudo dd if=SPL of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1k seek=1; sync

- Flash the u-boot-dtb.img image into the micro SD card:

sudo dd if=u-boot-dtb.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1k seek=69; sync

- Jumper settings:

MMC Boot: JM3 Closed

- Connect the Serial cable between the Starter Kit and the PC for the console.
(J28 is the Linux Serial console connector)

- Insert the micro SD card in the board, power it up and U-Boot messages should
come up.

- Note: For loading Linux on Quad/Dual modules set the dtb as
  icorem6qdl> setenv fdt_file imx6q-icore.dtb
