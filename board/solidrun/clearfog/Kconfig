config TARGET_CLEARFOG_BASE
	bool "Use ClearFog Base static configuration"
	help
	  Use the ClearFog Base as the static configuration instead of the
	  default which uses the ClearFog Pro.

	  Runtime board detection is always attempted and used if available. The
	  static configuration is used as a fallback in cases where runtime
	  detection is disabled, is not available in hardware, or otherwise fails.

	  Only newer revisions of the ClearFog product line support runtime
	  detection via additional EEPROM hardware. This option enables selecting
	  the Base variant for older hardware revisions.

config CLEARFOG_SFP_25GB
	bool "Enable 2.5 Gbps mode for SFP"
	help
	  Set the SFP module connection to support 2.5 Gbps transfer speed for the
	  SGMII connection (requires a supporting SFP). By default, transfer speed
	  of 1.25 Gbps is used, suitable for a more common 1 Gbps SFP module.
