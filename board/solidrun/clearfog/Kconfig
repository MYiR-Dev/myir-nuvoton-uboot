	help
	  Use the ClearFog Base as the static configuration instead of the
	  default which uses the ClearFog Pro.

	  Runtime board detection is always attempted and used if available. The
	  static configuration is used as a fallback in cases where runtime
	  detection is disabled, is not available in hardware, or otherwise fails.

	  Only newer revisions of the ClearFog product line support runtime
	  detection via additional EEPROM hardware. This option enables selecting
	  the Base variant for older hardware revisions.
