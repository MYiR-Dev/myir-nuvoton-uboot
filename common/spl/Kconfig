config SPL
	bool

	prompt "Enable SPL"
	help
	  If you want to build SPL as well as the normal image, say Y.

config SPL_SYS_MALLOC_SIMPLE
	bool
	depends on SPL
	prompt "Only use malloc_simple functions in the SPL"
	help
	  Say Y here to only use the *_simple malloc functions from
	  malloc_simple.c, rather then using the versions from dlmalloc.c;
	  this will make the SPL binary smaller at the cost of more heap
	  usage as the *_simple malloc functions do not re-use free-ed mem.

config SPL_STACK_R
	depends on SPL
	bool "Enable SDRAM location for SPL stack"
	help
	  SPL starts off execution in SRAM and thus typically has only a small
	  stack available. Since SPL sets up DRAM while in its board_init_f()
	  function, it is possible for the stack to move there before
	  board_init_r() is reached. This option enables a special SDRAM
	  location for the SPL stack. U-Boot SPL switches to this after
	  board_init_f() completes, and before board_init_r() starts.

config SPL_STACK_R_ADDR
	depends on SPL_STACK_R
	hex "SDRAM location for SPL stack"
	help
	  Specify the address in SDRAM for the SPL stack. This will be set up
	  before board_init_r() is called.

config SPL_STACK_R_MALLOC_SIMPLE_LEN
	depends on SPL_STACK_R && SPL_SYS_MALLOC_SIMPLE
	hex "Size of malloc_simple heap after switching to DRAM SPL stack"
	default 0x100000
	help
	  Specify the amount of the stack to use as memory pool for
	  malloc_simple after switching the stack to DRAM. This may be set
	  to give board_init_r() a larger heap then the initial heap in
	  SRAM which is limited to SYS_MALLOC_F_LEN bytes.

config SPL_SEPARATE_BSS
	depends on SPL
	bool "BSS section is in a different memory region from text"
	help
	  Some platforms need a large BSS region in SPL and can provide this
	  because RAM is already set up. In this case BSS can be moved to RAM.
	  This option should then be enabled so that the correct device tree
	  location is used. Normally we put the device tree at the end of BSS
	  but with this option enabled, it goes at _image_binary_end.

config TPL
	bool
	depends on SPL && SUPPORT_TPL
	prompt "Enable TPL"
	help
	  If you want to build TPL as well as the normal image and SPL, say Y.
