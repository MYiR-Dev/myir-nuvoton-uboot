* TSEC-compatible ethernet nodes

Properties:

  - compatible : Should be "fsl,tsec"
  - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
  - phy-handle : See ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
  - phy-connection-type : See ethernet.txt file in the same directory. This
    property is only really needed if the connection is of type "rgmii-id",
    "rgmii-rxid" and "rgmii-txid" as all other connection types are detected
    by hardware.

Example:
	ethernet@24000 {
		compatible = "fsl,tsec";
		reg = <0x24000 0x1000>;
		phy-handle = <&phy0>;
		phy-connection-type = "sgmii";
	};

Child nodes of the TSEC controller are typically the individual PHY devices
connected via the MDIO bus (sometimes the MDIO bus controller is separate).

* MDIO IO device

The MDIO is a bus to which the PHY devices are connected.  For each
device that exists on this bus, a PHY node should be created.

Required properties:
  - compatible : Should define the compatible device type for the
    mdio. Currently supported string/device is "fsl,tsec-mdio".
  - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device

Example:

	mdio@24520 {
		compatible = "fsl,tsec-mdio";
		reg = <0x24520 0x20>;

		ethernet-phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
		};
	};
