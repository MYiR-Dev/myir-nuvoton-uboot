	  Say Y here to enable the imx6 pinctrl driver

	  This provides a simple pinctrl driver for i.MX6 SoC familiy,
	  i.MX6DQ/SL/SX/UL/DQP. This feature depends on device tree
	  configuration. This driver is different from the linux one,
	  this is a simple implementation, only parses the 'fsl,pins'
	  property and configure related registers.
