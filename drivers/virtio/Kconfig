# VirtIO is a virtualization standard for network and disk device drivers
# where just the guest's device driver "knows" it is running in a virtual
# environment, and cooperates with the hypervisor. This enables guests to
# get high performance network and disk operations, and gives most of the
# performance benefits of paravirtualization. In the U-Boot case, the guest
# is U-Boot itself, while the virtual environment are normally QEMU targets
# like ARM, RISC-V and x86.
#
# See http://docs.oasis-open.org/virtio/virtio/v1.0/virtio-v1.0.pdf for
# the VirtIO specification v1.0.
